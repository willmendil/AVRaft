Project in alpha. The idea is to make a small hand held arduino station that enables makers to quickly and easily test and set motors, sensors and other electronics without the need to fetch jumper wires etc... 

The program is written in C++ using platformio. The 3D files are also available to print with the details in the 3DPrint folder. Regarding the parts list, you will need:
